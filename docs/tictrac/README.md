# Tictrac Front End Developer Test

### Hi there!

I really liked the description of the test so I figured why not answer with an .md file as well. Stephen asked me during the interview that how would I build up a new module in my "framework" so I thought why wouldn't I create your tweet list app inside of **suit**. I hope you won't consider it as a usage of a CSS framework. I only used internal SASS mixins and Grunt tasks that I've created before.

## Optionally

* Dynamically populate the tweets using the data in the included JS file (`data.js`).

---------------------------------------

You have 1 hour. Take your time and relax, work as you would normally. We’re looking for
quality not quantity.

**Regards**
