						<h5>Suit</h5>
						<p class="note sub-note">Personal experiment</p>
						<p>
							Based on the ups &amp; downs of Snorky (see below) and Ustream's huge amount of redundant static
							code I started to play with my very own open source
							module based front end framework. My problem with the existing ones like Bootstrap and
							Zurb is that they are barely customizable without duplicating the codebase because you don't extend
							but mostly overwrite rules making the amount of required static asset quite large for mobile platforms
							and poor internet connection.
						</p>
						<p>
							In Suit's SASS based setup there's a structural
							and a design layer for each and every module. The core part resets, sets up and positions the
							elements while the theme part handles the design related CSS rules from gutters to block heights
							and from colors to border sizes declared in a config file. This way you can create custom
							themed elements by keeping the core properties and reduce the divergence among UI units.
							You won't overwrite but extend.
						</p>
						<p>
							Suit also includes Grunt tasks for SASS lint and CSS minify configured app-wisely. Therefore
							you can build up your pages based on the element requirements. For instance the group named
							<code>datasheet</code> compiled for this CV site uses only a fragment (2KB gzipped) of the <code>styleguide</code>
							app (yet 12KB).
						</p>
						<p>However it's pretty far from production ready you can watch Suit evolving on
							<a href="https://github.com/efbe/suit">Github</a>.

						<h5>Snorky</h5>
						<p class="note sub-note">Ustream, 2010 — Present</p>
						<p>
							Named after the funkiest member of The Banana Splits, Snorky is our cross product UI module
							collection for several Ustream projects from the customized Zendesk-based
							<a href="https://support.ustream.tv/">Support Center</a> to
							<a href="https://www.ustream.tv/product/demand-video-lead-generation#product-features-wrap">Ustream Demand</a>'s
							feature listings.
						</p>
						<p>As we began to separate several side-projects from the monolithic code of
							Ustream.tv there was a demand for partly customizable stand-alone building bricks and widgets
							so I decided to develop and store them in an own repository where anyone can access, maintain
							and extend them.
						</p>
						<p>
							After a year or so we have dozens of modules, plugins, extensions and even entire
							apps like this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8e1uv0myzeh4ghb/snapshot_snorky_slider.png?dl=0">video slider</a>
							which combines the seek bar module with the buttons extended with icons.

						<h5>Resumable Video Uploader</h5>
						<p class="note sub-note">Ustream, 2010 — Present</p>
						<p>
							Ustream's current video uploader interface is using 23's <a href="http://resumablejs.com/">Resumable.js</a> lib
							integrated into the custom JS framework of the site. The challenging part was to combine native Resumable functions
							like <code>.pause()</code> and <code>.progress()</code> with the dashboard's UI elements and
							form fragments. The uploader also uses the button module of my Snorky project mentioned above.
						</p>
						<p>
							This feature requires special privileges so I've made a
							<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5fgp4eqg8jmzw24/snapshot_video_uploader.png?dl=0">snapshot</a>.

						<h5>Ustream Pro</h5>
						<p class="note sub-note">Ustream, 2010 — Present</p>
						<p>From the upfront <a href="https://www.ustream.tv/platform/plans">pricing page</a> to the last submit
							button of Ustream's flagship product the recurring Pro Broadcasting platform, our job was to
							make the subscription flow as easy and hassle-free as possible. This was my first project at Ustream
							where the two <strong>front end developer</strong>s, the UX expert and the owner of the product
							worked together from the very beginning. Starting with the first prototypes and user stories finishing with
							documentation and CasperJS tests.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here's a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qkeerylw61z4ew8/snapshot_smart_card_form_fragment.png?dl=0">snapshot</a>
							of my favourite part of the sign up form. We call it smart credit card module. It selects
							your card type based on the entered number, creates a hint for your CVV field according to the
							card type and also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ap5qc4l7t9judu4/snapshot_smart_card_overview_screen.png?dl=0">prepares</a>
							a familiar preview panel for the overview. (This 2 step version of the purchase flow is only
							available for Japanese locale, that's why you see the Kanjis.)

						<h5>Ustream Ad Free</h5>
						<p class="note sub-note">Ustream, 2010 — Present</p>
						<p>The small brother of Pro Broadcasting is <a href="https://www.ustream.tv/ad-free-viewing">Ad Free</a>
							with a 3-phase landing page, based on the client's browser resolution. It also has an
							integrated sign up form (which is only available for registered users) and the above
							mentioned smart credit card module.
						</p>
						<p>If you look at my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ha8ndc6nr7ev35f/snapshot_adfree_form_mobile_view.png?dl=0">mobile view snapshot</a>
							carefully you can notice a Minion and his button in the upper right corner. This is a treat
							for the fellow QA workers from one of my mates and me. Based on a PHP get param he appears
							and if you focus into any of the inputs on the form and press the button it fills out the
							entire form based on the field types and requirements.
						</p>
						<p>The Ad Free and Pro landing pages both use the illustrative icon module developed for my Snorky project.</p>

						<h5>Kirzen</h5>
						<p class="note sub-note">Docler Holding, 2009 — 2010</p>
						<p>
							The online dictionary was one of the Docler empire's experimental labs. Besides <strong>front
							end development</strong> on a daily basis I started to learn about <strong>user experience design</strong>.
							After analyzing &amp; deconstructing online UI elements I designed and built a complex language
							selector/translator and several admin tools for interns. Sadly Kirzen was closed in 2011.

						<h5>Network.hu</h5>
						<p class="note sub-note">Network.hu, 2007 — 2009</p>
						<p>
							At the dawn of social media <a href="http://network.hu/">Network.hu</a> was one of the first
							community sites in Hungary besides the since deceased iWiW. As the half party of the
							<strong>front end developer</strong> team beyond building &amp; maintaining the entire
							platform's UI, my favourite part was to come up with an easily customizable design layer to the
							so called club pages: [something].network.hu. In cooperation with the designer guy we came up
							with a strict rule based HTML + CSS package system for each type of content boxes from slide shows
							to polls and even link colors. Therefore you could easily apply a consistent and unique color scheme
							to your page. This was way before SASS and front end frameworks.

						<h5>Career Portal</h5>
						<p class="note sub-note">Nexum, 2006 — 2007</p>
						<p>
							As a <strong>junior front end developer</strong> of my role was to customize
							the company's out of the box online HR software called <a href="http://www.nexum.hu/en/references/career-portals">Career Portal</a>
							for international clients like Unilever, British American Tobacco and Sanoma. This
							customization meant both applying the clients corporate identity and extending the core
							functions with additional UI elements from navigation items through form fragments to entire
							landing pages.

							while travelling around, watching entire seasons of Netflix series, playing basketball, hiking
							and even compiling music <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/efbe/">into mixes</a> from rough
