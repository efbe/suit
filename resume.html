			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>I guess my passion for (de)constructing things in order to understand their functionality goes back to
				the nursery school's LEGO era. I always wanted to know how things work especially when it comes to details.
				I believe that an interface is only as good as its worst part because people won’t notice if something
				works naturally only when it’s odd and difficult to use or understand. To create a slick GUI everything
				has to be smooth under the hood as well and that’s where precise coding comes in. Mixing my enthusiasm
				for clean and modular code with my keen eye for details makes me an ideal candidate.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my spare time, away from the computer I do regular stuff like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/balazsfoky/">taking pictures</a> while travelling around,
				binge watching Netflix series, playing basketball, hiking and even compiling music <a href="https://mixcloud.com/efbe/">into mixes</a>
				from rough Colombian cumbia to good old British drum&bass.

			<h2>Projects and experience</h2>
			<h3>Suit</h3>
			<p class="sub-note">Ongoing personal experiment</p>
			<p>Based on the ups and downs of <a href="#snorky">Snorky</a> and Ustream's huge amount of redundant static
				code I started to play with my very own modular theme approach. My problem with the existing frameworks
				like Bootstrap and Foundation is that they are barely customizable without duplicating the codebase
				making the amount of required static asset quite large.</p>
			<p>In Suit's SASS based setup there's a structural and a design layer for each and every module. The core
				part resets, sets up and positions the elements while the theme part handles the design related CSS
				rules from gutters to block heights, colors and border sizes declared in a config file so can create
				custom themed elements without touching the core properties and reduce the divergence among UI fragments.</p>
			<p>Suit includes Gulp tasks for SASS lint and CSS minify configured app-wisely therefore you can build up
				your pages and apps based on the element requirements. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/efbe/suit">take a peek</a>
				at it on Github.</p>

			<h3>ThemeForge</h3>
			<p class="sub-note">Iron-Group, 2016 — Present (part-time)</p>
			<p>ThemeForge is an internal tool for IronWeb which allows you to create different kind of themes for an
				existing website structure based on Angular and Bootstrap. My role here is to apply different themes
				onto the platform created by the designer team. Also to extend the designs with non-designed/or missing
				UI elements and to keep consistency within a theme if a new function or page is created.</p>

			<h3>Snorky</h3>
			<p class="sub-note">Ustream / IBM Cloud Video, 2015 — 2016</p>
			<p>Named after the funkiest member of The Banana Splits, Snorky is Ustream's cross product UI module
				collection for several projects from the customized Zendesk-based <a href="https://support.ustream.tv/hc/en-us">Support Center</a>
				to the <a href="https://www.ustream.tv/solutions/video-marketing-and-lead-generation-software#product-features-wrap">Video Marketing Module</a>'s
				feature listings.</p>
			<p>As we began to separate several side-projects from the monolithic code of Ustream.tv there was a demand
				for partly customizable, stand-alone building bricks and widgets so we decided to develop and store them
				in an separate repository where anyone can access, maintain and extend them.</p>
			<p>After a year or so there are dozens of UI fragments, plugins, extensions and even entire apps like this
				<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8e1uv0myzeh4ghb/snapshot_snorky_slider.png?dl=0">video slider</a>
				that combines the seek bar module with the buttons extended with icons.</p>

			<h3>Resumable Video Uploader</h3>
			<p class="sub-note">Ustream / IBM Cloud Video, 2014</p>
			<p>Ustream's current video uploader interface is using 23's <a href="http://resumablejs.com/">Resumable.js</a>
				lib integrated into the in-house JS framework of the site. The challenging part was to combine
				native Resumable functions with Ustream dashboard's code and interface.</p>
			<p>This feature requires special privileges so I've made a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5fgp4eqg8jmzw24/snapshot_video_uploader.png?dl=0">snapshot</a>.</p>

			<h3>Ustream Pro</h3>
			<p class="sub-note">Ustream / IBM Cloud Video, 2010 — 2016</p>
			<p>From the <a href="https://www.ustream.tv/platform/plans">pricing page</a> through the payment journey to
				the last submission email of Ustream's flagship product, our job was to make the subscription flow as
				easy and hassle-free as possible. The UX/Desing team and the developers worked together under the Product
				Owner from the very beginning, starting with the first prototypes and user stories through several A/B
				tests finishing with documentation and CasperJS test coverage.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qkeerylw61z4ew8/snapshot_smart_card_form_fragment.png?dl=0">Here's a snapshot</a>
				of my favourite part of the sign up form, the smart credit card module which selects your card type
				based on the entered number, creates a hint for your CVV field according to the card type and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ap5qc4l7t9judu4/snapshot_smart_card_overview_screen.png?dl=0">also
				prepares</a> a preview panel for the overview. (This 2 step version of the purchase flow is only
				available for Japanese locale hence the Kanjis.)</p>

			<h3>Ustream Ad Free</h3>
			<p class="sub-note">Ustream / IBM Cloud Video, 2013</p>
			<p>The younger brother of Pro Broadcasting is <a href="https://www.ustream.tv/ad-free-viewing">Ad Free</a>
				with a 3-phase responsive landing page. It also features an integrated sign up form (which is only
				available for registered users) and the above mentioned smart credit card module.</p>
			<p>If you look at my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ha8ndc6nr7ev35f/snapshot_adfree_form_mobile_view.png?dl=0">mobile view snapshot</a>
				carefully you can notice a Minion and his button in the upper right corner. This is a treat for the
				fellow QA guys from one of my mates and me. Based on a PHP get param he appears and if you focus into
				any of the inputs on the form and press the button it fills out the entire form based on the field
				types and requirements.</p>

			<h3>Kirzen</h3>
			<p class="sub-note">Docler Holding, 2009 — 2010</p>
			<p>The online dictionary was one of the Docler's experimental projects. Besides front end development on
				a daily basis I started to learn about user experience design. After analyzing and deconstructing
				concurrent sites, I designed and built a complex language selector/translator and several admin tools.</p>

			<h3>Network.hu</h3>
			<p class="sub-note">Network.hu, 2007 — 2009</p>
			<p><a href="http://network.hu/">Network.hu</a> was one of the first social media sites in Hungary alongside
				- the since deceased - iWiW, where as the half party of the front end development team - beyond building and
				maintaining the entire platform - we came up with a strict rule based HTML + CSS package system for
				each type of content entity way before front end frameworks and design systems.</p>

			<h3>Career Portal</h3>
			<p class="sub-note">Nexum, 2006 — 2007</p>
			<p>As a junior front end developer my role was to customize the company's out of the box online HR software
				called <a href="https://www.nexum.hu/en/references/career-portals">Career Portal</a> for clients like
				Unilever, British American Tobacco and Sanoma. This customization meant both applying the corporate
				identity and extending the core functions with navigation items, forms and stand-alone landing pages.</p>
